# Scientific Computing with Python 

This repository documents my daily learning journey through the **FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python** course.  
I’ll be committing small, meaningful changes every day — from simple exercises to mini-projects — to track my progress and stay consistent.

## Goals
- Strengthen my Python fundamentals
- Build problem-solving skills
- Develop a daily coding habit
- Share progress openly on GitHub

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1 (TBD):** [To be added after my first commit]
